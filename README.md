#Problem:
In the world there exist an ample amount of data, and usually the handling of that data is quite a hectic task.
Seaborn is one of the most well-known Python packages for creating stunning visuals. Because it is constructed on top of Matplotlib, it can be thought of as an extension of that library.

#Seaborn:
Seaborn is a Python module that is mostly used for statistical plotting. It comes with nice default styles and colour palettes that make statistical charts more attractive.

#Seaborn VS Matplotlib:
1. Matplotlib is used to create basic graphs, whereas Seaborn uses fascinating themes.
2. Matplotlib is a graphical tool for data visualisation in Python that works well with NumPy and Pandas, while Seaborn is more at ease with Pandas data frames. In Python, it employs a simple collection of techniques to create stunning graphics.
3. Matplotlib is a flexible and powerful plotting library, whereas Seaborn avoids overlapping of plots with the help of its default themes.

#Install Seaborn:
Install it using this command if Python and PIP are already installed on a system:

```pip install seaborn```
